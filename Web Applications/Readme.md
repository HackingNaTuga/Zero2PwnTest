# Web Applications Security

This section focuses on different techniques, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors related to web applications.  
It covers both **footprinting/enumeration** phases and exploitation of common weaknesses found in modern web technologies.

## Topics Covered

- **Footprinting & Enumeration**  
  Techniques to gather information about the target application, identify technologies, and map potential attack surfaces.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  Understanding and exploiting reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**  
  Identifying and exploiting SQL injection flaws to retrieve, modify, or delete data from databases.

- **Command Injections**  
  Identifying and exploiting SQL injection flaws to retrieve, modify, or delete data from databases.  

- **File Upload**  
  Exploiting insecure file upload functionalities to achieve code execution or bypass restrictions.

- **Server-Side Attacks**  
  Attacks targeting server-side logic, such as server-side template injection (SSTI) and server-side request forgery (SSRF).

- **XML External Entity (XXE)**  
  Exploiting XML parsing misconfigurations to read files, perform SSRF, or execute denial-of-service attacks.

- **Broken Access Control & Authentication**  
  Identifying and bypassing improper authorization and authentication mechanisms.

- **File Inclusion**  
  Exploiting Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.

- **Miscellaneous**  
  Other web application attack vectors that do not fit into the above categories.

- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**  
  Enumeration and exploitation of common CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

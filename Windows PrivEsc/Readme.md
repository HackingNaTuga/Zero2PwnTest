# Windows Privilege Escalation

This section focuses on the various techniques, tools, and methodologies used to escalate privileges in Windows environments during security assessments or penetration tests.  
Our goal is to pbilrovide a structured and methodical approach for identifying privilege escalation opportunities, understanding how Windows privileges work, and exploiting misconfigurations or vulneraities to gain higher-level access.

## Topics Covered

- **Getting the Lay of the Land**  
  Initial reconnaissance of the target system to identify OS version, installed patches, running services, and potential misconfigurations that may lead to privilege escalation.

- **Windows User Privileges**  
  Understanding user-level privileges in Windows and how improper configurations can allow elevation of rights.

- **Windows Group Privileges**  
  Exploring group memberships such as *Administrators*, *Backup Operators*, or *Remote Desktop Users*, and leveraging them for privilege escalation.

- **Attacking the OS**  
  Exploiting vulnerabilities, kernel flaws, insecure service configurations, or weak permissions on critical system files.

- **Credential Theft**  
  Extracting credentials from memory, registry hives, or configuration files using tools like Mimikatz or leveraging LSASS dumps.

- **Restricted Environments**  
  Techniques to escape sandboxes, break out of limited shells, or bypass application whitelisting controls.

- **Additional Techniques**  
  Other approaches such as DLL hijacking, abusing Scheduled Tasks, exploiting weak service permissions, and leveraging third-party software misconfigurations.

- **Dealing with End of Life Systems**  
  Special considerations and exploits for outdated and unsupported Windows versions that no longer receive security patches.

By the end of this section, you should be able to systematically identify privilege escalation paths, exploit them, and maintain elevated access in a controlled, ethical testing environment.

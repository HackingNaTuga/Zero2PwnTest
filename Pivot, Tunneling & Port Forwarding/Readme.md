# Pivoting, Tunneling & Port Forwarding

This repository aims to explain and document the concepts of **pivoting**, **tunneling**, and **port forwarding** as used in network penetration testing and red team operations to move within internal networks and access restricted services.

## Contents

### 1. Pivoting
**Pivoting** is the technique of using a compromised host as an access point to reach other systems that are not directly accessible. It enables lateral movement within a network by routing traffic through an intermediary system.

### 2. Tunneling
**Tunneling** involves encapsulating one network protocol within another to bypass firewalls, filtering rules, or network restrictions. It allows data to be transmitted securely or covertly between systems.

### 3. Port Forwarding
**Port forwarding** redirects network connections from one address/port combination to another. It allows access to internal services by forwarding traffic through an accessible system.

- **Local Port Forwarding** – Redirects traffic from the local system to an internal service.
- **Remote Port Forwarding** – Makes an internal service accessible from outside the network.
- **Dynamic Port Forwarding** – Creates a flexible proxy to route traffic to multiple internal services.

## Purpose
The purpose of this material is to provide a clear and structured reference for studying these techniques in **controlled laboratory environments** and **authorized scenarios**, always respecting applicable laws and regulations.

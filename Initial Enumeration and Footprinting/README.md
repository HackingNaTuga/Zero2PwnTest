# Enumeration and Footprinting

Enumeration is a widely used term in cyber security. It stands for information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods. It is important to note that OSINT is an independent procedure and should be performed separately from enumeration because OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gathering and does not involve active enumeration of the given target. Enumeration is a loop in which we repeatedly gather information based on what data we have or have already discovered.

Information can be gathered from domains, IP addresses, accessible services, and many other sources.

Once we have identified targets in our client's infrastructure, we need to examine the individual services and protocols. In most cases, these are services that enable communication between customers, the infrastructure, the administration, and the employees.
